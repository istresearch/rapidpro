# RapidPro (PULSE Branding)

### Custom Theme
The custom theme should be modified within the brands/pulse/less directory, so it doesn't conflict with future RapidPro releases. There are two files: variables.less and styles.less. This is where the core RapidPro css is overwritten.

### Pulse Logo
Rapid Pro relies heavily on fonts. The Pulse Logo is treated as a font and uses an SVG backup for browsers that don't support fonts. The process to generate the PULSE logo is to first create as an SVG.  The SVG is imported into IcoMoon (https://icomoon.io) where ttf, eot, and woff fonts are generated. These files need to live in brands/font/fonts.  

### favicon
The favicon is located at brand/pulse/pulse.ico.
